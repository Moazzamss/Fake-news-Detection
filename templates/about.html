            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>
                This system uses machine learning models to classify news articles as either fake or real. 
                By analyzing the text, it can predict the authenticity of the news using a variety of models.
                The system is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it accessible for both researchers and general users.

            <h2>System Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                The system consists of a backend running Flask, which processes user input through machine learning models. 
                The frontend is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for a responsive user experience. 
                The backend communicates with machine learning models stored locally to predict whether a news article is real or fake.

            <h2>Dataset</h2>
            <p>
                The dataset used for training our models consists of labeled news articles, with a classification of "Real" or "Fake." 
                This dataset is preprocessed by removing irrelevant content, such as advertisements and author names, 
                and tokenizing the text into words for feature extraction.

            <h2>Machine Learning Models</h2>
            <p>
                The system uses several machine learning models to classify news articles:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Random Forest (RF)</strong>: A versatile and powerful ensemble method.</li>
                    <li><strong>Decision Tree (DT)</strong>: A simple, interpretable tree structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Logistic Regression (LR)</strong>: A linear model for binary classification.</li>
                    <li><strong>Naive Bayes (NB)</strong>: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem.</li>
                </ul>
                These models are trained on text features such as word frequencies and are used in combination to ensure accurate predictions.
            </p>

        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>
                To use the system, you simply paste a news article into the provided textarea. 
                The text is processed by the backend, where it is passed through the trained machine learning models. 
                The final prediction is made based on a majority vote from the individual models. 
                The system then displays whether the article is predicted to be "REAL" or "FAKE."

        <section class="about-section">
            <h2>Limitations & Future Work</h2>
            <p>
                While the system provides a good baseline for detecting fake news, it is not perfect. 
                The models may struggle with articles that have subtle language or lack clear indicators of being fake or real. 
                Future work will involve:
                <ul>
                    <li>Improving the models' accuracy by training on a larger, more diverse dataset.</li>
                    <li>Incorporating additional features such as sentiment analysis or article source reliability.</li>
                    <li>Providing real-time feedback and improving user interactivity.</li>
                </ul>
